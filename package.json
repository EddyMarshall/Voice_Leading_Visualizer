  "description": "Overview:  To understand this project, we must first understand voice leading. Good      voice leading in music is the technique of changing chords as      efficiently as possible. First, know that a chord in music is comprised of      multiple notes played simulataneously. Take C major for instance. When you      play C major, you're really playing the notes C, E, and G. E minor is E, G,     and B. Many guitarists will jump all over their instrument to go from C to G,     when really, they only have to change one single note! (CEG --> BEG).",
